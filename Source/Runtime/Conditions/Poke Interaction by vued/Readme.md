## Poke interactions

# Recommended versions

Unity 2022
Built on VR Builder 2.7.1. 
Requires XRIT 2.3.0 or later to work.

# Installation

- Setup VR Builder.
- Upgrade XR Interaction Toolkit to version 2.3.0. Note that this might break things in your project or VR Builder standard functionality (as of version 2.7.1).
- Add "Starter Assets" from XR Interaction Toolkit samples.
- Unzip the PokeInteraction_Runtime archive in the same folder.
- Navigate to `Source/Editor/Poke Interaction by vued` and do the same with the PokeInteraction_Editor archive.

# How to use

Add the "Push Button" prefab from the samples to your scene. Reference it in a "Poke Object" condition and press `Fix it`.

Note that this condition currently does not fully support locking and autocompletion.

Enjoy.
