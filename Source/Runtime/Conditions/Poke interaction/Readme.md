# How to use

Setup VR Builder.

Upgrade XR Interaction Toolkit to version 2.3.0. Note that this might break things in your project or VR Builder standard functionality.
Add "Starter Assets" from XR Interaction Toolkit samples.

Add the "Push Button" prefab from the samples to your scene. Reference it in a "Poke Object" condition and press fix it.

Enjoy.
