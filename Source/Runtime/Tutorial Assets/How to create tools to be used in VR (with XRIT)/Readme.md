# How to create tools to be used in VR (with XRIT)


## General information

This is the unity package containing all the required assets to follow Mindport's ["How to create tools to be used in VR (with XR Interaction Toolkit)"](https://www.mindport.co/vr-builder-tutorials/how-to-create-tools-to-be-used-in-vr-with-unitys-xr-interaction-toolkit) tutorial.


This tutorial explains how to create a barcode scanner that works in VR using Unity’s XR Interaction Toolkit. The scanner is activated by holding the trigger on the VR controller and if it’s positioned in front of a valid label it will scan the label's barcode and provide acoustic feedback, i.e. a "beep" will be played.
