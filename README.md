## Getting Started
The easiest and simplest way to get started and try out VR Builder is by downloading the latest version from our [Git Repo](https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder) or the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/vr-builder-open-source-toolkit-for-vr-creation-201913).

Make sure to follow VR Builder [tutorials](https://www.mindport.co/vr-builder/tutorials) and read the [documentation](https://www.mindport.co/vr-builder/manual/online-documentation) for a deeper understanding of how the tool works.

Templates for behaviors and conditions can be found in this repo. Feel free to use them as a base to develop your own!
